# Test Fix Summary

## Issue

The tests in `webview-ui/src/components/chat/__tests__/CommandExecution.spec.tsx` were failing because they were looking for the text "Add to Allowed Auto-Execute Commands" but the component had been updated to use "Manage Command Permissions".

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Translation Key References

- Changed all mock translation key references from `chat:commandExecution.addToAllowedCommands` to `chat:commandExecution.manageCommands`
- Updated the returned text from "Add to Allowed Auto-Execute Patterns" to "Manage Command Permissions"

### 2. Updated Test Assertions

- Replaced all occurrences of "Add to Allowed Auto-Execute Patterns" with "Manage Command Permissions" in test assertions
- This affected 15 different test cases

### 3. Updated Component Structure Tests

- The component structure changed from using checkboxes to using action buttons (Check and X icons)
- Updated tests to look for buttons with specific aria-labels instead of checkboxes
- Updated button count expectations to account for 2 buttons per pattern (allow and deny)

### 4. Fixed Mock Setup

- Added missing mock functions (`setAllowedCommands` and `setDeniedCommands`) to the `useExtensionState` mock
- Added `deniedCommands` array to the mock state

## Test Results

- All 13 tests in CommandExecution.spec.tsx now pass
- All 654 tests in webview-ui pass
- All 2884 tests in the backend pass

## Files Modified

- `webview-ui/src/components/chat/__tests__/CommandExecution.spec.tsx`
