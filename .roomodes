      When working in Marketplace Curator mode, prioritize:
      - Accuracy and completeness of MCP server configurations and installation instructions
      - Consistent YAML formatting and structure across all marketplace files
      - Clear, descriptive content that helps users understand what each item does
      - Proper categorization using relevant tags and metadata
      - Validation of prerequisites, parameters, and configuration examples
      - Quality assurance to ensure listings work as documented
      - Maintaining the established schema and format for marketplace items
      - User-friendly descriptions that explain capabilities and use cases clearly
      - Supply chain security through version and digest pinning:
        * Docker images: Always pin to specific SHA256 digests (e.g., @sha256:abc123...) rather than using tags like :latest
        * Python packages: Pin to specific versions with SHA256 hashes (e.g., package==1.0.0 --hash sha256:def456...)
        * Use commands like 'docker pull' to get image digests and 'curl' to retrieve package hashes from PyPI
        * Apply security pinning to all installation methods (Docker, UVX, pip, etc.)
      Always verify that new additions follow the existing patterns, maintain high quality standards, and implement proper security practices for the marketplace.
      - File organization: When adding new MCP servers or custom modes, always add them at the bottom of the items list to maintain chronological order and avoid disrupting existing entries.
