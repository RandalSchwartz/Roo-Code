# Command Whitelisting UI Location Summary

## Overview

The command whitelisting feature has been successfully moved from VS Code's native settings to the Roo Code plugin's settings interface. This consolidates all auto-approval settings in one convenient location.

## Previous Location (REMOVED)

- **VS Code Settings**: `Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Roo Code`
- **Setting Name**: `roo-code.commandWhitelist`
- **Access**: Required navigating through VS Code's settings UI or editing `settings.json`

## New Location (CURRENT)

The command whitelisting feature is now located in:

### Access Path

1. Open the Roo Code extension panel in VS Code
2. Click on the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the top toolbar
3. Navigate to the **Auto Approve** section
4. Find the **Execute** subsection

### UI Components

Within the Auto Approve > Execute section, you'll find:

1. **Enable/Disable Toggle**

    - Label: "Auto-approve command execution"
    - Controls whether commands can be auto-approved

2. **Command Patterns List**
    - Label: "Command patterns"
    - Description: "Add command patterns that can be auto-approved (e.g., 'npm test', 'git status')"
    - Features:
        - Add new patterns using the input field
        - Remove patterns with the Ã— button
        - Patterns support wildcards (\*)
        - Empty list means no commands are auto-approved

### Example Patterns

- `npm test` - Auto-approves exact command
- `npm *` - Auto-approves any npm command
- `git status` - Auto-approves git status command
- `*` - Auto-approves all commands (use with caution)

## Migration

- Existing command whitelist settings from VS Code settings are automatically migrated to the new location on first launch
- The old VS Code setting (`roo-code.commandWhitelist`) is removed from `package.json`
- Users don't need to manually transfer their settings

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Settings**: All auto-approval settings (read, write, execute) are now in one place
2. **Better UX**: No need to navigate VS Code's complex settings structure
3. **Visual Consistency**: Matches the UI pattern of other auto-approve settings
4. **Easier Discovery**: Users can find all related settings together

## Technical Details

- Setting is stored in the global state using key: `commandWhitelist`
- Synchronized across VS Code instances
- Supports the same pattern matching as before
- Maintains backward compatibility through automatic migration
