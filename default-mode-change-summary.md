# Default Mode Change Summary

## Request

Change the default mode from "Code" to "Architect" for new users installing the app for the first time.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The change has already been successfully implemented in the codebase.

## Implementation Details

### Key File: `src/shared/modes.ts`

- **Line 124**: `export const defaultModeSlug = "architect"`
- This setting controls the default mode for new users

### Available Modes

The system supports the following modes (in order):

1. **code** - 💻 Code: Write, modify, and refactor code
2. **architect** - 🏗️ Architect: Plan and design before implementation (**DEFAULT**)
3. **ask** - ❓ Ask: Get answers and explanations
4. **debug** - 🪲 Debug: Diagnose and fix software issues
5. **orchestrator** - 🪃 Orchestrator: Coordinate tasks across multiple modes

### Architect Mode Configuration

- **Role**: Experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner
- **Purpose**: Gather information and create detailed plans for accomplishing tasks
- **Tools**: Read files, edit markdown files only, browser access, MCP tools
- **Workflow**: Information gathering → Planning → User approval → Implementation in other modes

## Verification

- ✅ `defaultModeSlug` is set to "architect" in `src/shared/modes.ts`
- ✅ "architect" is a valid mode slug in the modes array
- ✅ All references to `defaultModeSlug` throughout the codebase will use "architect"
- ✅ Build completes successfully with no errors
- ✅ Test mocks are isolated and don't affect the actual default behavior

## Impact

New users installing the app will now start in **Architect mode** instead of Code mode, encouraging them to:

1. Gather context about their tasks
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Create detailed implementation plans
4. Get user approval before switching to implementation modes

This change promotes better planning and reduces the likelihood of rushing into implementation without proper understanding of requirements.
